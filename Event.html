<p> The Cyber Security Awareness Workshop is a special educational event designed to help students understand the importance of online safety in today’s digital world. With technology growing so fast, cyber threats like phishing, data theft, fake websites, and password hacking have also increased. This workshop aims to spread awareness about how these attacks happen and how to protect personal and organizational data effectively.

During the session, participants will learn the basics of ethical hacking, which focuses on identifying and fixing security weaknesses rather than exploiting them. Experts from the Department of Computer Science will guide students through real-life examples and live demonstrations, showing how hackers think and how cybersecurity professionals defend systems.

The workshop also includes hands-on activities such as detecting phishing emails, creating strong passwords, and exploring safe browsing habits. There will be interactive quizzes, group discussions, and a question-answer round to make learning engaging and practical.

By the end of the workshop, students will not only gain knowledge of cyber safety but also develop awareness about digital ethics and responsible online behavior. Every participant will receive a certificate of participation, recognizing their effort to become more cyber-aware and responsible digital citizens.</p>
